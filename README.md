# HOMEWORK DEV AND DELIVER

## TASK WAS TO CREATE AN API FOR DOCKER. UNFORTUNALETY, FOR TODAY, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS (ACTUALLY I HAVE, RIGHT NOW)

### What`s more, I did not have time to finish it all.

## Finished:

- NodeJS/ Express to start application and load necessary modules.
- Pure API
- MongoDB/Mongoose to create accounts and store their random id
- Passport to log users
- Authenticate the routes
- Redis to cache some data.

## What is left:

- ...started on passport JWT
- move mongokey to .env
- check TypeScript and Docker
- create a SWAGGER doc

## What I do not like:

- password (backend) verification does not exist yet
-
